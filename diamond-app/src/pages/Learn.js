Carat weight is the most objective of the 4Cs â€“ it's measured using a highly calibrated digital scale that captures weight precisely to the hundred thousandths of a carat.",

      keyPoints: [
        "Cut quality is graded on a scale from Excellent to Poor",
        "The cut affects brightness (reflection of white light), fire (dispersion of light into colors), and scintillation (sparkle and pattern of light and dark areas)",

  const faqs = [
    {
      question: "How is a diamond's price determined?",
      answer: "A diamond's price is determined by the 4Cs (carat, cut, color, and clarity), with carat weight having the most significant impact. However, other factors such as polish, symmetry, fluorescence, and market conditions also affect pricing. Our estimator tool uses regression models based on actual market data to provide accurate price estimations."
    },
    {
      question: "Which diamond characteristic offers the best value?",
      answer: "For the best value, many experts recommend prioritizing cut quality over other characteristics. A well-cut diamond will appear more brilliant and can even appear larger than its actual carat weight. Consider diamonds in the G-J color range and VS1-SI1 clarity range for an excellent balance of quality and value."
    },
    {
      question: "Why do diamonds with the same carat weight vary in price?",
      answer: "Diamonds of equal carat weight can vary dramatically in price due to differences in the other 3Cs: cut, color, and clarity. Additionally, factors such as fluorescence, polish, symmetry, and proportions impact pricing. Two 1-carat diamonds could differ in price by thousands of dollars based on these other quality factors."
    },
    {
      question: "How accurate is the price estimate from this tool?",
      answer: "Our price estimator uses statistical models derived from real market data to provide estimates within approximately 15% of actual retail prices. However, the tool provides a general guide rather than an exact valuation. Actual prices may vary based on additional factors such as fluorescence, exact proportions, market conditions, and retailer markup."
    },
    {
      question: "What diamond characteristics should I prioritize for my budget?",
      answer: "For most budgets, prioritize cut quality first as it has the most impact on a diamond's beauty. If working with a limited budget, you can save by choosing a slightly lower color grade (G-I) and clarity grade (VS-SI) that still appear beautiful to the naked eye. Carat weight has the largest price impact, so even slightly reducing size (e.g., from 1.0 to 0.9 carat) can significantly reduce cost."
